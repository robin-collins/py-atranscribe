00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Oh?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh.

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Oh. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. up to turn out here. Good. But, good around, nice. I didn't know that much earlier in a bit sweet. Yeah, it's doing a great night. It's probably one of my bed. Oh my gosh. Oh, yeah. I was too sure you would do about it. They like, you're like to get a cheeky. Well, no, yeah. I'm't know. I don't see if you're better. The L.S. It's not the gas on that. Take extra oxygen, so you're about as tough as you can be.

4
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 You go the rifle, you got like five minutes of oxygen.

5
00:02:39.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I don't think you know how it's a good hand, it'd be good, starting to leave it. We can't stop anything else yet. Nothing yet. You want dash rather than further resistance? Probably. Well that's 5% period after any out of oxygen. Yeah. I'm not sure. Yeah, well, it's select... Wait it. You need to do it. Go down, look at the top. That? Which one? No, that one. No one. That one. That. Whatever. We're selected, isn't it? No, livery. No. No. What is this? No. Dash read, and 12. Yes, read, and 12. Do we take message since? No. No. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Is that an extra... Oh, oops. Can't read? Yeah. I guess if you got to the thing before, I've been, you know.

6
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 I got that I've been by. It's worth buying, I guess. Go out on the halfway done? Well, that one, off, isn't that?

7
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 That'll give us a real biggest guy.

8
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Do that.

9
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Wow, look at it.

10
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 I know.

11
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 It looks at it.

12
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Is that many? Get out of here?

13
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Yeah.

14
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Go in it.

15
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Ooh, it looks choppy. You should be able to kick ass though. Because now you shoot and it's like, what? 32 damage, so that should be... All the sharks should be under through. They can kill them. Or at least the sharks we can do like this.

16
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Do I have any missions at all?

17
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 None.

18
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Right now, I wait up yet.

19
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Get through the delivery ship door.

20
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 See that ship you're out?

21
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Yeah.

22
00:05:37.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 You go down there now and cut through the door since you gave you a gas cutter or something. What are you practice? How are you practice? I mean. Wait, fox. Looks. And... I think... Very, hey. Where you just box?

23
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Freaking me out, mate.

27
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Flamed you could have that.

28
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 It's level up.

29
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Okay.

30
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 There's not on there.

31
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 I was going to get him really good.

 Okay, we get you. Okay. Move up. We're shot it halfway back your head. Yeah. I'm not quite accurately. I don't know. I'm going to accurately. It would be nice to do you just the the moment now, is that the fucker.

34
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Yeah.

35
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000

 Amen. Oh, man, the way there. No. No. No of the room now. I look up and over and... It's an exception, because clearly the thing is here. Okay. Give by the next. What's my friend? You fight bullets to shoot gun. You're fighting. That's just better for a long time practice with you fucking hard for you. More powerful than you pit, the machine goes away.

39
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 That's just better for a long round, you know, but...

40
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 It's scary threats, because you can go to the resistance.

41
00:09:34.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Right now you get it back. This is right. This is the right. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm......withal......their...
