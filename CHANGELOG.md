## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Optimized `api/Dockerfile` build: consolidated RUN steps and improved caching, reducing build time.
- Enhanced outputs now segment transcripts by diarization speaker turns, collating ASR chunk texts into each turn—`.srt`, `.tsv`, and `.txt` will reflect true multi-speaker structure.
- Queue printing now only outputs when a file is newly enqueued, eliminating repeated spam for unchanged queue status.
- Console summary now uses metadata.language and metadata.audio_duration to correctly display detected language and file length instead of defaulting to `None` and `0.0s`.
- Manual SRT formatting integrated to ensure `.srt` files are correctly generated from transcript segments; removed reliance on `srt.compose` for robustness.
- Pre-flight check for Whisper model existence: verifies a local file or HuggingFace model repo before loading and logs the outcome.
- EnhancedWhisperTranscriber now logs when the HuggingFace pipeline begins downloading/loading a model and when it's ready.
- WhisperFactory logs whether it's using a local model file, a predefined size, or a HuggingFace repo, and fails fast if the HF model is missing.
- WhisperConfig.model_size now accepts arbitrary HuggingFace model IDs (owner/repo) in addition to predefined sizes.
- File monitoring now sorts pending files by modification time and only enqueues the oldest batch (up to `health_check.queue_size_max`) per scan to prevent overload and ensure prompt processing.
- TranscriptionService now prints live queue status (queued and processing counts) inline with each queued file, e.g.: `📁 Queued: filename.ext — queued=100, processing=1`.
- SubtitleManager: `_save_txt` now sorts segments by start time and appends a trailing newline to ensure complete text coverage.
- SubtitleManager: `_save_tsv` now sorts segments by start time and adds a trailing newline to guarantee non-empty, correctly ordered TSV output.

### Fixed
- **Definitive Fix for All Flash Attention and GPU Issues (2025-01-27)**
  - Implemented a final, robust solution to permanently resolve all recurring crashes and warnings related to Flash Attention 2.0.
  - **Root Cause**: The `output_attentions=False` parameter was being set incorrectly during the transcription call. For the `transformers` pipeline, this must be set at **model initialization**.
  - **Solution**:
    - The `output_attentions=False` parameter is now correctly passed in the `model_kwargs` when the `pipeline` is first created.
    - The incorrect and ineffective runtime checks have been removed from the `transcribe` method.
  - This ensures the model is correctly configured from the start, resolving the `ValueError` and aligning with the library's intended use.
  - Modified: `src/transcription/enhanced_whisper.py`

### Changed
- **Dependencies Alignment (2025-01-27)**
  - Aligned dependencies between `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` files

    - Fixed version specifications to use exact versions (==) where specified in requirements.txt for `faster-whisper==1.1.1`, `pyannote.audio==3.3.2`, `transformers==4.47.1`, `ffmpeg-normalize==1.32.5`, `noisereduce==3.0.3`, `numpy==1.26.4`, `scipy==1.14.1`
    - Removed duplicate `ruff>=0.12.1` from main dependencies (already present in dev dependencies)
  - Both dependency files now have consistent and aligned package versions
  - Modified: `pyproject.toml` - dependencies section

### Fixed
- **Enhanced Whisper CUDA and Warning Issues Fix (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed Flash Attention 2.0 model not being moved to CUDA after initialization
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Flash Attention models require explicit `.to(device)` call after pipeline creation
  - **SOLUTION**: Added explicit model device transfer and comprehensive optimizations:
    - Explicitly move Flash Attention model to CUDA after pipeline creation
    - Enable TensorFloat-32 (TF32) for enhanced CUDA performance
    - Enable cuDNN auto-tuner for consistent workloads
    - Added comprehensive warning filters for repeated warnings:
      - Flash Attention device warnings (handled explicitly)
      - Transformers input name deprecation warnings
      - Attention mask warnings (handled in generation)
      - PyAnnote TF32 warnings (enabled intentionally)
      - PyTorch std() warnings from pyannote.audio
      - Whisper timestamp prediction warnings
    - Enhanced generation parameters with proper timestamp and attention handling
  - Flash Attention models now properly utilize GPU acceleration
  - Console output significantly cleaner with suppressed repeated warnings
  - **FOLLOW-UP FIX**: Removed conflicting `attention_mask` parameter from generation kwargs that caused "got multiple values for keyword argument" error
  - Modified: `src/transcription/enhanced_whisper.py` - initialization, optimizations, warning filters, generation parameters

- **Diarization Method Name Error Fix (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed AttributeError "'Diarizer' object has no attribute 'diarize_audio'" in enhanced_batch_transcriber.py
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Code was calling non-existent `diarize_audio` method when the actual method is `diarize`
  - **SOLUTION**: Fixed method call and added proper async execution:
    - Changed `await self.diarizer.diarize_audio(file_path)` to proper async executor pattern
    - Used `loop.run_in_executor()` with correct `diarize` method
    - Converted file path to string as expected by the method
  - Diarization pipeline now works correctly without AttributeError
  - Modified: `src/pipeline/enhanced_batch_transcriber.py` - line 253

- **TSV Format None Timing Values Fix (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed TypeError "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float'" in subtitle output formats
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Some transcript segments had None values for start/end times causing arithmetic errors
  - **SOLUTION**: Added comprehensive null safety across all subtitle formats:
    - Added validation to skip segments with None timing values
    - Added detailed logging for skipped segments to aid debugging
    - Applied fix to TSV, SRT, WebVTT, JSON, and TXT formats
    - Enhanced `_format_timestamp()` and `_seconds_to_webvtt_time()` to handle None values
  - All subtitle formats now handle malformed timing data gracefully
  - Modified: `src/output/subtitle_manager.py` - lines 195, 225, 265, 285, 315, 420, 428

- **Enhanced Batch Transcriber TypeError Fix (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed multiple TypeError "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float'" in enhanced_batch_transcriber.py
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Code assumed `chunk.get("timestamp", [0, 0])` always returns a list, but some chunks had `None` timestamps
  - **SOLUTION**: Added comprehensive null checking and validation for timestamp data:
    - Uses walrus operator to efficiently assign timestamp once
    - Checks if timestamp is not None
    - Validates timestamp is a list or tuple
    - Ensures timestamp has at least 2 elements
    - Validates both timestamp values are numeric (int or float)
    - Added logging for skipped chunks with invalid timestamps
  - Duration calculation now safely skips invalid timestamp data instead of crashing
  - Fixed in multiple locations:
    - Line 323: metadata duration calculation
    - Line 400: statistics audio duration calculation
    - Line 354: chunk to segment conversion with validation and logging

- **Post-Processing and Output Organization Fixes (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed Enhanced Batch Transcriber not following post-processing configuration settings
  - **ROOT CAUSE 1**: Enhanced batch transcriber had simplified post-processing that ignored backup_structure config
  - **ROOT CAUSE 2**: Enhanced batch transcriber saved some output files directly to root output directory, bypassing format organization
  - **SOLUTION**: Updated enhanced_batch_transcriber.py to match regular batch_transcriber behavior:
    - Fixed `_post_process_file` to implement proper date-based backup structure (e.g., `/data/backup/2025-07-20`)
    - Fixed `_generate_enhanced_outputs` to use SubtitleManager for all formats ensuring proper subdirectory organization
    - All output formats now correctly organized into subfolders (`/data/out/srt`, `/data/out/tsv`, `/data/out/txt`, etc.)
    - Added datetime import for date-based backup functionality
  - Modified: `src/pipeline/enhanced_batch_transcriber.py` - lines 289, 383, imports

- **Enhanced Batch Transcriber AttributeError Fix (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed AttributeError "'SubtitleManager' object has no attribute 'create_subtitle_file'" in enhanced_batch_transcriber.py
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Code was calling non-existent `create_subtitle_file` method on SubtitleManager
  - **SOLUTION**: Replaced with correct `save_transcripts` method call:
    - Removed erroneous `await` keyword (method is synchronous)
    - Updated method parameters to match `save_transcripts` signature
    - Fixed return value handling to work with dict-based response format
  - Enhanced batch transcription pipeline now properly generates multiple subtitle formats (WebVTT, LRC, TSV) without errors
  - Modified: `src/pipeline/enhanced_batch_transcriber.py` - fixed method call in `_generate_enhanced_outputs`

- **NumPy/SciPy Compatibility Issue & Container Restart Loop (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed Docker container startup error caused by version mismatch between NumPy and SciPy
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Modified Dockerfile to install correct versions LAST to prevent override:
    - NumPy 1.26.4 and SciPy 1.14.1 now installed with `--force-reinstall` after other packages
    - Prevents requirements.txt dependencies from overriding explicit version constraints
    - Ensures working versions persist on container rebuild
  - Pinned exact working versions: NumPy==1.26.4 and SciPy==1.14.1 in requirements.txt
  - Enhanced Dockerfile with more aggressive dependency resolution:
    - Clears pip cache to prevent cached incompatible wheels
    - Uninstalls conflicting packages (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas)
    - Tests critical imports during build process to catch issues early
  - Disabled automatic container restart (`restart: "no"`) in docker-compose.yaml to prevent restart loops
  - Added fail-fast dependency testing in entrypoint.sh to exit cleanly on import errors
  - Resolved `ValueError: All ufuncs must have type 'numpy.ufunc'` error during pyannote.audio import

### Changed
- **Output Directory Organization (2025-07-04)**
  - Modified subtitle manager to organize output files by format type into subdirectories
  - Each transcription format (SRT, WebVTT, TXT, JSON, TSV, LRC) now gets saved in its own subdirectory under the output directory
  - Updated `SubtitleManager._save_single_format` to create format-specific subdirectories automatically
  - Improved file organization making it easier to locate specific format types
  - Example: `/output/srt/`, `/output/txt/`, `/output/json/`, etc.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-03

### Added - Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics

### Fixed
- **English-Only Model Crash Fix (2025-01-27)**
  - Fixed a `ValueError` crash when using English-only Whisper models (e.g., `distil-whisper/distil-small.en`).
  - **Root Cause**: The code was unconditionally passing `task` and `language` parameters to the generation pipeline, which is not supported by English-only models.
  - **Solution**: Added a check to detect if the model is English-only (by checking if the model name ends with `.en`). The `task` and `language` parameters are now only added for multilingual models.
  - This ensures compatibility with both English-only and multilingual Whisper models.
  - Modified: `src/transcription/enhanced_whisper.py`

- **Resolved WhisperFlashAttention2 attention error by disabling word-level timestamps in enhanced_whisper.py, aligning with insanely-fast-whisper reference.**
- Removed suppression thresholds in enhanced_whisper.py to prevent empty transcriptions on valid audio, matching insanely-fast-whisper behavior.
- Added explicit model.to(device) after pipeline creation in enhanced_whisper.py to ensure proper GPU initialization for Flash Attention 2, preventing empty transcription results.

### Added
- Create `.env.example` file listing placeholders for environment variables: `ADMIN_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, and `FLY_MACHINE_ID`.
