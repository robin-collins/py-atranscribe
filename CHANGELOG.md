### Changed
- **Linting & Code Quality Improvements**
  - Refactored `src/diarization/diarizer.py` to fix docstring formatting (D205), justify broad exception usage (BLE001), and improve structure for Ruff compliance.
  - Refactored `src/monitoring/file_monitor.py` to address nested ifs (SIM102), magic values (PLR2004), and logging best practices (G004).

  - Improves reliability by ensuring only completed audio files are processed

### Linting Compliance
- **Ruff Lint Fixes (2025-07-02)**
  - Manually resolved all Ruff errors and warnings in `src/monitoring/file_monitor.py`:
    - Moved all imports to the top of the file (E402).
    - Replaced all f-string logging calls with logger formatting (G004).
    - Removed redundant exception objects from `logger.exception` (TRY401).

    - Reduced return statements in `update_file` to comply with PLR0911.
  - `src/monitoring/file_monitor.py` is now fully Ruff-compliant.

### Fixed
- Suppressed TRY300 warning in `src/diarization/diarizer.py` by adding `# noqa: TRY300` to the return statement within the exception handler.
