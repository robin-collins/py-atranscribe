# Update app to skip recent audio files (2025-07-02 11:18Z)

_**User**_

can you update this app so that it does not try and process the most RECENT audiofile in the directory its monitoring, thus the most recently created audio file in that folder NEVER gets processed (unless its older than 24hrs)
